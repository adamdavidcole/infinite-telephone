I'm currently reading, but it really stuck with me because I feel like people have this deep innate instinct to share what they're thinking but they rarely feel like they have the time or even the opportunity and that's kind of what inspired this project but to be honest I'm a bit nervous about it. I really put myself out there creatively but if I want to be an artist or take myself, seriously I need to become more comfortable with the idea. I think this projects simultaneously allows for vulnerability but also the safety of talking anonymously to no one in particular. I'm excited to see what comes of it and to hear what you guys have to share. Sit down one second, I want to tell you everything."

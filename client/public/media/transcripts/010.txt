So I think this idea of independence is really interesting and I'm sure lots of people said this but it's all we got but we as people we try to find community in lots of different spaces and we try to balance these things independence and individualism and being part of something let that be biological or cultural or topical I think there's a difference between genetics and being part of a family vs. feeling like you are part of something that you have an allegiance to and I think also of course choice plays into that what you choose to be part of vs. what you may have been given initially

my dad's side of the family when I was growing up is really big and we would always get together for people's birthdays and Thanksgiving was like a huge holiday and put Thanksgiving in particular like 30 people would all crammed around my parents like multiple assembled tables in the dining room and these conversations would just feel like flying across the table like there'd be so many different conversations going on in like little different corners and then somebody would here like a conversation down the table and stop what they were saying and then turn to be like oh my God like jump into the other conversation and everyone has a yelling at its really loud and  I have to imagine it's like very intimidating for people who don't come from large families to experience that and I know that that's like not for everyone but something I guess that's why I feel so at home with my group of friends right now is it's a very similar Vibe of just like everybody kind of goes with the flow and makes each other laugh and just stops around and I like the thick of it the flower attitude of our conversation Style

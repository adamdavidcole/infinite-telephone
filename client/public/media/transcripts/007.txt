My family had. Kind of a similar dynamic. When we were young I feel like especially on my father's side we would go out to Kansas city and. My father has lots of brothers and sisters which means that we have lots of cousins and we we kind of see them a lot and it was really nice they they have like lots of family barbecues the kinds of his expectation that everyone is around all the time and you know every other weekend to spend together and you come home a lot but then as like my immediate family got older I think my dad stopped bringing us around there is much not really sure what that is about getting older where where like. You know the expectation that you make that big commute goes down. But it's kind of sad it's like you you lose. No one large part of your family. At the same time I guess you get you get a little bit closer with the with the other side my mom's family is all in New York and kind of the northeast. But. It's it is weird you have these people that you're kind of once close to and then just because of the distance it's like you know when you see them again that you that you you know you should be close and like you are close in a lot of ways but just kind of your changing circumstances you don't you know kind of feel the same way about them as you do about everybody else.

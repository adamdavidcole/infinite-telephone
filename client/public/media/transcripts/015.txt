I'm not sure if you can hear it quite right but outside is the sound of thousands of white oak leaves rustling in the humid breeze and its a way to put the sense of sound towards something less tangible like the movement of air and its humid air you could say the humid air has a little more weight to it a little more gravity to it not just vacant air it's weighty air I'll put it up again if you can hear but it's a rustling it's kind of a roar. It's sort of alive ambiance that's ever present in the night air and there's crickets as well but the crickets are almost kind of a tertiary element the oak are the dominant notes that are being played and every year you hear the oak leaves the world and this block and acre around you is alive and there are things that are moving that are not you and not the things around you and not insects or animals or birds but something that's been there for decades older than us since mid century and they'll probably be here quite a bit longer and they don't speak as loudly in mid winter there's other sounds but it doesn't really have the same weight to it if you listen to the rustling it can kind of put you to sleep its a lullaby, its impossible to make a distinction between the leaves kind of like waves, it's impossible to pick out a single wave in a rolling sequence of waves it's impossible to pick out one trees leaves in the night sky

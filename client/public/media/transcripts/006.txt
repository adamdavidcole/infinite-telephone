Yeah it's it's interesting you say that because my my family group were me and my siblings were up with a lot of cousins and we used to go to all you know family functions and holidays together and and play together but as we as we grow up we kind of drifted apart and a lot of my extended family had some major issues you know a little a little bit of dysfunction with within their family and so it kind of brought my family apart from my cousins and as the years went by our togetherness as a giant family kind of dwindled and eventually it was basically just my immediate family my my 2 parents and my 2 siblings at family function of course we would you know invite our our grandparents and sometimes first and and and second cousins but we really didn't spend a lot of time with our extended family as we went through our young adulthood and even now we we we rarely see our extended family which is kind of sad but I think it brought my immediate family together a little bit more and it made us appreciate all the all the times we you know we spent together for various holidays or family functions which I I'm kind of conflicted about because I see other families huge families who all get together and make a huge point to be together. But I don't know it's it's kind of. For my immediate family it really works for us and it's kind of like. It it it it it it just makes our time together you know fun. Without any influences from our extended family who may bring in some negative vibes which has happened in the past.

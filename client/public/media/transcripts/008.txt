Being away from family and friends is definitely something. And I think about. It's not on a day to day basis these weekly. I think sometimes. Your your groove and you're doing on saying. What do you think about it. And at the end of the day was really important. To you is that the job. Is this the traveling exploring places. News cities. But. Perhaps it's really our relationships that matter. And if at the end of life. You regrets spending so much time away from your family. You might wish you had made some. Changes to how you. Carried out here. You for your career are your travel destinations. I guess that's something I contemplate a lot. And I think everyone the end of the day. Goes to the grocery store. They all die says he's the same way. They celebrate with fans celebrate birthdays holidays traditions. So while places are. It looks different this different architecture. Why do you. Where you're from because the thing that you need. There are the. In the event that you have. You only have one shot at this. Great life so. It's kind of hard to rationalize. Running away from the people that brought you into the world.

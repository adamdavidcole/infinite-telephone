Yea family, the exact opposite your group without any cousins and just a super small family where it's me and my two brothers and parents my grandparents and so was never that really like boisterous loud jokey atmosphere it was like a couple of kids really more reserved older people like all our family holidays infections and stuff and so I think I found myself really drawn towards those kinds of friend groups in like friends families who are really loud and boisterous and kind of provide more space for like joking and having a good time together and I see that in my my siblings to where they're drawn more towards those kind of environments and it's been interesting to see how that translated back towards now that word. How about translated back towards our family and kind of changing the family Dynamic when were together and functions and creating a different different atmosphere

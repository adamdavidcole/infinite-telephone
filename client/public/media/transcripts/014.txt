The last one that Peter did is so beautiful and genuine and touchy and so much about humidity and how it makes a place or not and how humidity is making him feel like home and that's one of the specific things about this place Southold that there is humidity that comes from the bay like the air is all of the bay and salt just sitting on you like salt shakers that get clogged up in the air and it's like the place I've been living in Hilo is also by the sea and there is a sense of that in the air, and I never want to live but also like this particular week we've had the last couple days before people came was super hot and humid and you can just feel it stagnant just sitting on everybody and we had the rain and it just like broke and after it breaks its so beautiful and fresh and these past couple days have been so beautiful and clear and the breaking of the humidity is like if you get used to it in a particular way you can enjoy the change of it if you appreciate the hot you can appreciate the cold and if you appreciate the cold you can enjoy the hot the rain that we've gotten to break the humidity and clear and breezy and sitting on the beach and taking all that in and I feel very blessed to be in this place in July of 2021
